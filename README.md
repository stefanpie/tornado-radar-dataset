# tornado-radar-dataset

Contains various scripts and data files I used to build a dataset of doppler weather radar scans from NOAA's archives containing tornados. The scripts and data files are not sorted no organized since I put this together quickly to build up the dataset quickly. There are future plans to organize these scrips and merge them with a bigger data science project analyses the scans for new methods of identification and prediction.
